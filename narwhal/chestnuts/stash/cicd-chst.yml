Test Driven Development:
write test
  - failing test
  - write code to make the test succeed

---((John 11-AUG-2021))
  rather than break the code first
  break the test first
  test is your obstacle
  clearly defined obstacle....you can write code that can clr]early run the algorithm you want to run

    what you would like something to happen
      how to make that happen

      - might

      - writing the test first what you want to have happen
